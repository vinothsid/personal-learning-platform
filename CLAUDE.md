### Key Patterns Established

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then implementation
2. **Atomic Design**: Components organized as atoms â†’ molecules â†’ organisms
3. **Interface Abstraction**: Storage layer uses interfaces for extensibility
4. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with comprehensive interfaces
5. **Validation**: Input validation with user-friendly error messages
