    â””â”€â”€ page.tsx        # Home page with demo and upload
```

### Key Patterns Established

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then implementation
2. **Atomic Design**: Components organized as atoms â†’ molecules â†’ organisms
3. **Interface Abstraction**: Storage layer uses interfaces for extensibility
4. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with comprehensive interfaces
5. **Validation**: Input validation with user-friendly error messages

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server (localhost:3000)
npm test            # Run full test suite (105 tests)
npm run test:watch  # Run tests in watch mode
npm run build       # Production build
npm run lint        # ESLint validation
npm run type-check  # TypeScript compilation check
```

## Current Todo List Status

All foundational items completed. Current priorities:

### Next Development Phase (High Priority)

1. **File Processing Implementation**
   - Process uploaded documents (PDF, DOC, TXT parsing)
   - Extract text content for flashcard generation
   - Auto-generate flashcards from document content

2. **YouTube Video Integration**
   - YouTube URL validation and metadata extraction
   - Video embedding with timestamp support
   - Link flashcards to specific video timestamps

3. **Content Management System**
   - Content upload and organization interface
   - Tag-based content filtering and search
   - Content-to-flashcard relationship management

### Medium Priority

4. **Study Session Management**
   - Progress tracking and analytics
   - Study session history and statistics
   - Performance metrics and insights

5. **Advanced Study Features**
   - Custom study modes (cramming, review-only)
   - Study streaks and gamification
   - Spaced repetition scheduling dashboard

## Recent Changes (Last Session)

### Upload Feedback & Management System Implementation

- **Enhanced DocumentUpload Component**:
  - Added comprehensive upload status feedback (uploading, success, error)
  - Visual state indicators with color-coded borders and icons
  - Detailed status messages with file information
  - Auto-clearing messages after 5 seconds
  - Proper loading states and disabled interactions during upload

- **New UploadedItemsList Component**:
  - Real-time display of uploaded documents and YouTube links
  - File type icons and metadata (size, upload date)
  - Delete functionality with proper error handling
  - Loading states and error recovery
  - Integration with storage service for persistent data

- **Storage Integration**:
  - File processing with automatic content record creation
  - Content type detection based on file extensions
  - Real-time list refresh after uploads and deletions
  - Comprehensive error handling throughout the upload pipeline

### Code Quality Improvements

- Added 9 comprehensive tests for UploadedItemsList component
- Updated DocumentUpload tests for new functionality
- Fixed all TypeScript errors and ESLint warnings
- Improved React hooks usage with proper dependency management
- Maintained 100% test success rate (105 tests total)

## Integration Points for Next Session

### File Processing Integration

The DocumentUpload component is ready for integration with file processing:

```typescript
// In src/app/page.tsx
const handleFileSelect = (files: File[]) => {
  // TODO: Process uploaded files
  // 1. Read file content based on type
  // 2. Extract text for flashcard generation
  // 3. Save content using StorageService
  // 4. Create flashcards linked to content
};
```

### Storage Service Usage

Existing storage patterns to follow:

```typescript
import { StorageService } from '@/services';
const storage = new StorageService();

// Save content
await storage.saveContent(content);

// Create flashcards
await storage.saveFlashCard(flashcard);

// Search and filter
const results = await storage.searchFlashCards(query);
```

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Features

1. **Create Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feat/feature-name`
2. **Write Tests First**: Create comprehensive test suite (TDD)
3. **Implement Feature**: Write minimal code to pass tests
4. **Refactor**: Improve code while maintaining green tests
5. **Run Quality Checks**: `npm test && npm run lint && npm run build`
6. **Commit**: Use conventional commit format with detailed description
7. **Create PR**: Include comprehensive description and test plan

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Service interactions and data flow
- **Component Tests**: React component behavior and props
- **Accessibility Tests**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Code Quality Standards

- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, dependency inversion
- **Clean Code**: Meaningful names, small functions, clear intent
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with comprehensive interfaces
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Git configured with GitHub access
- Modern browser for testing

### Quick Start

```bash
cd /Users/sahanavinoth/Projects/ganglia/learning-platform
npm install
npm run dev  # Starts on localhost:3000
```

## Important Notes for Continuation

### Current PR Status

- **PR #3** is open and ready for review
- Contains document upload functionality
- All tests passing, build successful
- May need to be merged before continuing with file processing

### Next Logical Steps

1. **Wait for PR #3 merge** or work on separate feature branch
2. **Implement file parsing** for uploaded documents
3. **Add YouTube integration** as per original requirements
4. **Build content management interface**

### Technical Debt

- File upload currently logs to console (needs real processing)
- No error toast notifications yet (placeholder console.error)
- Content processing pipeline not implemented

### Repository Maintenance

- Regular dependency updates
- Monitor test coverage as features grow
- Consider CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Database migration planning for production deployment
